## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax
for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on
using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that
includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code
chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

``` r
summary(pressure)
```

    ##   temperature     pressure       
    ##  Min.   :  0   Min.   :  0.0002  
    ##  1st Qu.: 90   1st Qu.:  0.1800  
    ##  Median :180   Median :  8.8000  
    ##  Mean   :180   Mean   :124.3367  
    ##  3rd Qu.:270   3rd Qu.:126.5000  
    ##  Max.   :360   Max.   :806.0000

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

![](Test1_files/figure-gfm/pressure-1.png)<!-- -->

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to
prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
